## Parallel window deconding enables scalable fault tolerant quantum computation: 

- Decoherence.
- Data stream speeds:
    - 1MHz in superconducting
- Data backlog makes qc run exponentially slower.
- Terhal backlog argument.

- Offline decoding works for Clifford circuits.
- Blocking operations exist with magic state distillation, teleportation, and lattice surgery.

- Minimum weight solution (minimum-weight perfect matching)
- Make the buffer the same size as the distance.

- A little known fact of QEC is that if the decoder infrastructure cannot keep up, a data backlog problem is encountered and the quantum computer runs exponentially slowe. 

- Some sub-linearity can be seen due to paralleliza-
tion overheads in software, particularly for low-distance
codes where the decoding problem is relatively simple.

- Logical clock: time it takes to execute one logical non-Clifford gate.

- Time overheads can be exchanged for qubit overhead. 
- Percolation theory arguments show that for a distance d code, the largest error clusters are typically of size O(polylog(d).

Questions:
    - measurement and qubit error difference on the graph?
    - what is the point of the buffer?
    - artificial defects
    - rough top/bottom
    - matching vs non-matching decoder.
    - why is logical clock defined as it is?


## Scalable surface code decoders with parallelization in time:

- Minimum weight perfect matching and union find 
- Therefore, the error correction between consecutive non-Clifford gates should be fast enough to keep up with the rapidly decohering quantum hardware, so that the error syndromes do not backlog

- For the surface code, each cycle of detectors is the XOR of two consecutive cycles of syndromes

- Detectors are 0 when there is no fault (gate, qubit idling, and initialization (resp., measurement). 

- A detector to be open if there is a fault which flips that detector but no other detector of the same type;otherwise, it is closed

- Formally, a defect is annihilated if it is incident to an odd number of edges in the set.

Questions:
    - How do you read error plots? 
    - What are feed forward operations?
    - Is online error correction still lagging behind the quantum operations because there are future windows?

Questions:
    - Transversal clifford operations?


## Managing Classical Processing Requirements for Quantum Error Correction

- fewer decoders result in an exponential increase in the memory required to store undecoded syndromes,

## Localized statistics decoding: A parallel decoding algorithm for quantum low-density parity-check codes
- Even with specialized hardware, inverting the matrix of a graph of this size cannot realistically be achieved within the decoherence time of a typical qubit
- The algorithm is reliability-guided in that it uses prior knowledge of the error distribution to strategically select I so that the solution Ë†e[I] spans faults that have the highest error probability. Reliability can be derived from the devices error model or soft information output from a pre-decoder.
- For low physical error rates, the decoding problem for QLDPC amounts to solving a sparse system of linear equation

    - What is a devices error model?

- Quantum degeneracy
  - impact on the logical qubit
  - definition of the logical qubit themselves are needed

throughput better than generation time. 
- generation time
  - atom arrays: 50ms
  - superconducting: surface d microseconds, qldpc higher weight checks 2d 12-24 microseconds.

magic state distilation uses reed miller codes.

- surface code is faster time to solution. Each code only has one qubit. Sciquantum photonics.
