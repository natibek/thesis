1. benchmarking different decoders for surface code

2. benchmarking different decoders for qldpc
- windowed belief propagation
- quantum memory benchmarking? 

3. write one qldpc decoder
- new literature

parallel window decoder, parallelized decoding alg for qldpc. 

can you decode qldpc codes in real time?
yes, optimization are required for this. 
parallel window and benchmarking a variety of different codes.


background, prior work, need for decoding, qldpc, what i plan to do

real time decoding 
this is the inner decoder and the outer window based decoder scheme.
both affect the ability to do real time decoding 
prior work that has been done 
window but not parallel window decoding 
timeline ->
